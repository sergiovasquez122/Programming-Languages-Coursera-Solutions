# Pure OOP
# Ruby is fully committed to OOP
#
# Simpler, smaller semantics
# Can call methods on anything
# - May just get a dynamic undefined method error
#
# Almost everything is a method call
# - Example: 3 + 4
#
# All code is methods
# - All methods you define are part of a class
# - Top-level methods just added to Object class
# All objects also have methods
# - methods
# - class
#
# Can use at run-time to query "what an object can do" and respond accordingly
# - Called reflection
#
# Also useful in the REPL to explore what methods are available
# - May be quicker than consulting full documentation
#
# Another example of "just objects and method calls"
