; Parentheses matter
; You must break your of one habit for Racket:
; - Do not add/remove parens because you feel like it
;   - Parens are never optional or meaningless!!!

; - In most places (e) means call e with zero arguments

; so ((e)) means call e with zero arguments and call the result with zero arguments

; Without static typing, often get hard-to-diagnose run-times errors
