- For implementing our grid so far, SML / Racket style usually by column and Ruby / Java style usually by row
- But beyond just style, this decision affects waht software extensions need not change old code
- Functions 
-- Easy to add a new operation
-- Adding a new variant requires modifying old functions, but ML type-checker gives a to-do list if original code avoided wildcard patterns

Objects 
-- easy to add a new variant
-- adding a new operation requires modifying old classes, but Java type checker gives a to-do list if original code avoided default methods
